I don't think my heart would be strong enough to take it. To all those who say he has ulterior motives, I wonder if you would be saying it if this was a woman instead of a man. Be careful what you say. Reputations of innocent men can be ruined by comments like these. I know you said you didn't want thanks Mohammed, but I am thanking you anyway.

333706;;post;"I think the reason for the negative comments are experiences of abuse, hearing stories of abuse constantly, and the fact that people from the middle east are painted as evil terrorists. I can understand if an individual who didn't have a happy childhood or didn't have a close and healthy relationship with their parents, especially with their fathers can have this unsettling view of this guy.

 That being said, I don't think this man deserves that kind of attitude or treatment. He's performing a kindness so rare to be honest my own brain had trouble registering and I find that sad. The video even says it, these kids aren't adopted because no one wants to deal with death; to care, nurture, and love a sweet little soul knowing they're going to die is not something a lot of people want to deal with but he's doing it because someone has to care for them. They deserve a warm homemade meal, kisses when they're sad, to laugh and to be tucked in nicely in a soft and warm bed. Even if they're going to live for one more month, and I find it more upsetting that people condemn him instead of realizing how many foster kids have probably died without knowing that love. It's bad enough healthy foster kids  have a low probability of adoption, these sick kids have an even lower chance.
I get it, people have glimpsed evil but I like to believe people are innocent until proven guilty. Personally I don't believe he is a sick man to want to hurt these kids; you don't want attention on you when you want to hurt someone, you want to remain hidden and anonymous and he's fostered 40 kids and buried 10, that leaves 30 children and probably a handful would say something if he did abuse them.";Neutral;Neutral

""I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, 'What's 2+2?' And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. 
First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, '10101000101', on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

252599;Why don't missing black girls get the same media coverage as white girls?;post;"That is untrue. Google search relisha her name relisha rudd turms up many articles.   And you can go onto FBI stats for missing persons every year. Yes certain cases seem to get a lot pf media attention.  It's usually circumstances though not race. In Natalie Holloways case she vanished while on a high school trip in a foreign country.  Her suspected killer walked and killed another girl later her parents were very active in her case and made numerous media outlets twll their story.  In the case of Chandry Levy also a top Google serch, was killed by her scumbag boyfriend politician and he got away with it. In the case of Relisha.  The last day she was seen 2-2614. She was not reported missing until 3-1_14. On 3-25_14 FBI offers 25k reward. Relisha disappeared and the people she was with ""the janitor amd his wife sold her"". Her mother sold her to the janitor.  
Sex trafficking is real and more kids disappear from homeless shelters,  through CPS, churches and the very organizations established to protect them than are even reported.  In other countries parents sell kids to pay debts. It is similar here but not discussed. Remember some one has to report a child missing first. Children run away from Foster Care and a "" parent "" won't report them missing so they can still collect a check for them.
We live in a sick world,  yes independent sick people commit horrible acts. But the bigger problem and the larger numbers of kids "" missing "" are those that society never hears about. We don't want to face the fact that churches sell children.  We don't want to admit that pizzagate is real. I conclude by saying that any child missing should hold the highest priority in our police force and in our community. But they are not. Who is still looking for Relisha?  Even the Holloways and Levy family have had to hire PI and do their own research and yet they still have no answers, no justice.";Neutral;Neutral

But,  GMO's (Genetically Modified Organisms)  are vital to our continued prosperity. GMO's are not just food. GMO's produce many drugs that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive or unethical to produce. Human Insulin is one of those drugs (without which, millions of diabetics would die). GMO's also make fuels and other chemicals for industrial use. They can also break down toxic chemicals that would otherwise take tens to millions of years to break down otherwise. Humans have been (mildly) genetically modifying organisms for tens of thousands of years through selective breeding (farm cows are not found in the wild, nether are poodles or beef tomatoes). Even in natural settings bacteria have been known to take genes from one organism's cells and then a few generations later insert that genetic code into another organism that could not possibly breed with the first organism.  Viruses also genetically modify organisms (odds are if you are reading this (and are human) you yourself have been genetically modified through viral infection).;Neutral;Neutral

I can only imagine the shame and the hypocrisy by the islamists, if there was proof, that it was a fellow islamist, who didn't like the fact, that the girl studied.

Couple that with the fact that many immigrants are doing jobs that many Americans won't do, for less than what we'd demand, and aren't covered by FMLA, able to get private insurance, and their employers do not have to meet ANY of the requirements of fair pay, work hours, safe working conditions. All of which are benefits we as citizens have. Yet they're willing to work 12 hours a day in fields, construction, meat processing facilities, housekeeping, while making $2.00/hr with no benefits or coverage under labor law requirements. 
When I see US citizens willing to work for the same pay under the same conditions, I'll believe that we as a country are willing to let these people go back. Because without them, your produce, meat, building costs, lawn/childcare are going to go up exponentially due to employers having to pay fairly and adhere to federally mandated rules. 
So don't complain when your lettuce is $2.99, lawncare is $250/month, and childcare is over $300/week.

That's what our US society is now days. We really don't care about the problem until it actually happens to us it is stupid and we lack empathy because of it.";Neutral;Neutral

There are time limits on how long you are allowed to be in that gray area.  It's not a life time position,  I'm white, Irish, English, Indian from two of the five tribes, and Scottish,  my grandfathers second wife was Mexican, here legally, after her husband died she left back to Mexico, all the while was here legally before they got married.  Everyone one has time for the legal paper work.  Get caught with out it and get sent home, obtain it and you are no longer a visitor, you are one of the newest citizens of this country, and then congratulations will be in order.";Neutral;Neutral
205376;This is what it's like to be deported under President Trump.;post;It used to be easy to get papers. Now it's harder now it's a longer process, and now it's too see if you qualify and a lot more money which most immigrants don't have. Point of the video was majority of them were not even criminals and majority of them were there for years and they had rights until trump took them away just by a movement of a pen. It's not sympathy it's more protecting there rights on American land.;Neutral;Neutral
205377;This is what it's like to be deported under President Trump.;post;It's not easy for people of certain countries to get legal. The U.S. has quotas for each country they can allow people to come from. Sadly, Mexico and other central and southern countries reach their quota wait to fast and leaves many without being able to legalize for years. So it's not as easy as saying they had time. I'm sure if they could so easily legalize they wouldn't risk sacrificing their families, jobs etc.;Neutral;Neutral
205391;This is what it's like to be deported under President Trump.;post;"I am astounded with the amount of people who do not understand how laws work. If you break a law you get punished for it its as simple as that, did your parents fail to teach you any of this or are you too blinded by your foolish desire to virtue signal to understand this?

""b-b-b-b-but they don't have the money to come over!"" Don't care, not my problem, if they have to break the law to enter the states they don't deserve to be. I would expect the same to be done to me if I were to illegally cross the Canadian-US border.

""b-b-but Europeans came here illegally first!"" They couldn't have come here ILLEGALLY if there were no LAWS to break! Their were no nation states in the Americas before the Europeans arrival, no rule of law, only tribes ruling over what land they could take or conquer from other tribes.

205393;This is what it's like to be deported under President Trump.;post;Sad stories. Just remember. They broke our laws coming to America illegally. So everything after that doesn't matter. They could have been a perfect person. If you disagree with this think of it this way. Someone gets into your house. Takes a shower, puts your clothes on, sleeps in your bed, eats your food and sits on your couch when you walk in from your day. Don't get angry or call the police. It's the same thing as illegals coming into our country!;Neutral;Neutral

They are illegals, caught with drugs & you want us to feel sorry for them !!!

A lot of the men in particular are in for drug possession and then deported...the women who was raped and defended herself with a knife had an expired green card...im sorry...where am I supposed to feel sympathy? If i drive with an expired license I get arrested...we're acting like Trump is committing mass genocide, he's acting on the basis of the law...sorry...they're ILLEGALLY crossing the border...that is why these people are called ILLEGAL immigrants...it's ILLEGAL...give me a break guys...;Neutral;Neutral
205401;This is what it's like to be deported under President Trump.;post;What I do not get, is if I were to hypothetically cross illegally to Mexico...

205403;This is what it's like to be deported under President Trump.;post;Also realize that these people were caught doing illegal activities in order to get caught, and chose deportation, rather than remaining in a detention center. Also, this is getting out of hand. Almost every president has deported many many people from the U.S. this is not just Trumps doing.

And they just bypass the system and get to stay there with zero consequences for that many years?? Good job on ICE deporting their ass.;Neutral;Neutral
205417;This is what it's like to be deported under President Trump.;post;I love how these people say that they are criminals because they came here illegally. Might as well call the cops on your grandparents and all of your family, since you all came here illegally and started reproducing.
